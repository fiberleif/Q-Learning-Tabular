# Tabular-Q-Learning
This repo is to implement the value iteration and Q-Learning algorithms to solve mazes.
## Maze Environment
The files in env directory describle structure of the maze.  Any maze is rectangular with a start state in the bottom left corner and agoal state in the upper right corner. We use S to indicate the initial state (start state), G to indicate the terminal state (goal state), * to indicate an obstacle, and .  indicate a state an agent can go through. The agent cannot go through states with obstacles. You can assume that there are no obstacles at S and G. There are walls around the border of the maze. For example, an input file could look like the following:
```bash
.*..*..G
S......*
```
The environment comprises four key parts as follows:
### state space
The state is described by a tuple (x,y) where x is the row and y is the column (zero-indexed). obstacle locations are not including.

### action space
There  are  four  available  actions,  0,1,2,3,  at  each  state  and  they  correspond  to  the  directions West, North, East, South respectively.

### dynamic transition
The dynamic transition is **deterministic**:
* if an agent is at the initial state S and takes action 2 (East), then the next state of the agent is (1,1). 
* If the agent takes an action that would result in going into a state with an obstacle, it will instead stay in the same state. 
* If the agent takes an action that would result in hitting the wall, it will also stay in the same state.

### reward function
The goal of the agent is to take as few steps as possible to get to the goal state from the start state.  Hence, the reward is âˆ’1 whenever an agent takes an action, regardless of the state at which it takes an action.
## Value iteration
```bash
python code/value_iteration.py <maze_input> <value_file> <q_value_file> <policy file> <num_epoch> <discount_factor>
```
6 command-line arguments are described in detail below:
* **mazeinput**:  path to the environment input.txt.
* **value_file**: path to output the values $V(s)$.
* **q_value_file**: path to output the q-values $Q(s, a)$.
* **policy_file**: path to output the optimal actions $\pi(s)$.
* **num_epoch**: the number of train epochs.
* **discount_factor**:  the discount factor $\gamma$.

A simple example (tinymaze):
```bash
python code/value_iteration.py ./env/tiny_maze.txt vi_value_output.txt vi_q_value_output.txt vi_policy_output.txt 5 0.9
```

##  Q-Learning
```bash
python code/q_learning.py <maze_input> <value_file> <q_value_file> <policy file> <num_episode> <learning_rate> <discount_factor> <epsilon>
```
6 command-line arguments are described in detail below:
* **mazeinput**:  path to the environment input.txt.
* **value_file**: path to output the values $V(s)$.
* **q_value_file**: path to output the q-values $Q(s, a)$.
* **policy_file**: path to output the optimal actions $\pi(s)$.
* **num_episode**: the number of train episodes.
* **max_episode_length**:  the maximum of the length of an episode.
* **learning_rate**: the learning rate $\alpha$.
* **discount_factor**:  the discount factor $\gamma$.
* **epsilon**: the value $\epsilon$ for the epsilon-greedy strategy.

A simple example (tinymaze):
```bash
python code/q_learning.py ./env/tiny_maze.txt ql_value_output.txt ql_q_value_output.txt ql_policy_output.txt 1000 20 0.8  0.9  0.05
